# RFM Customer Segmentation

*Dataset:* [UCI Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)  
*Author:* Kaleem Ullah Sabir  

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project performs *RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis* on the Online Retail dataset to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.

### Task Description
- Analyze customer behavior based on:
  - **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase
  - **Frequency**: How often they made purchases
  - **Monetary**: How much money they spent
- Assign R, F, M scores to each customer
- Group customers based on these scores
- Suggest marketing strategies for each group (e.g., discounts for loyal buyers, re-engagement for inactive customers)

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  

## ðŸ“Œ Covered Topics
- Feature engineering  
- Segmentation logic  
- Customer analytics  
- Data visualization (bar charts, heatmaps)
