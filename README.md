# RFM Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project performs **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** on the Online Retail dataset (UCI) to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.

### Task Description
- Analyze customer behavior based on:
  - **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase
  - **Frequency**: How often they made purchases
  - **Monetary**: How much money they spent
- Assign R, F, M scores to each customer
- Group customers based on these scores
- Suggest marketing strategies for each group (e.g., discounts for loyal buyers, re-engagement for inactive customers)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  

## Covered Topics
- Feature engineering  
- Segmentation logic  
- Customer analytics  
- Data visualization (bar charts, heatmaps)

## Usage
1. Open `rfm_segmentation_notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.  
2. Run all cells to reproduce analysis and visualizations.  
3. Graphs are saved automatically in the repo as PNG files.  
4. `rfm_segments.csv` contains the final RFM scores and customer segments.
